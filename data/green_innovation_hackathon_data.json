This intensive 3-day team-based hackathon brings together passionate developers, designers, environmental scientists, and innovators to create cutting-edge technology solutions for environmental challenges. Teams will tackle real-world sustainability problems including renewable energy optimization, waste management automation, carbon footprint tracking, smart agriculture systems, and water conservation technologies. The hackathon features multiple tracks including CleanTech Solutions, Smart Cities, Circular Economy, Climate Monitoring, and Sustainable Transportation. Participants will have access to environmental datasets, IoT sensors, cloud computing platforms, AI/ML development tools, and sustainable technology APIs. Expert mentors from leading environmental organizations, tech companies, and research institutions will guide teams through solution development. The program includes workshops on environmental data analysis, green technology trends, sustainable design principles, life cycle assessment, and impact measurement methodologies. Teams will learn to build solutions using technologies like renewable energy modeling, environmental sensor networks, sustainability tracking applications, green blockchain solutions, and eco-friendly mobile apps. The hackathon promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between technologists and environmental experts to create practical, scalable solutions. Participants will work on projects ranging from smart waste sorting systems to renewable energy forecasting platforms, from carbon credit marketplaces to biodiversity monitoring tools. Expert judges include environmental scientists, sustainability consultants, green tech entrepreneurs, and climate policy experts. Winning solutions will be evaluated based on environmental impact potential, technical innovation, scalability, and implementation feasibility. The event features keynote speeches from climate tech leaders, panel discussions on green innovation trends, and networking sessions with environmental organizations. Participants gain valuable experience in environmental technology development, sustainability assessment, and green business model creation. The hackathon encourages solutions that can be deployed in real-world scenarios to make measurable environmental impact. All skill levels welcome - from coding beginners to environmental experts, design thinkers to data scientists. Teams must demonstrate clear environmental benefits and provide evidence-based impact projections for their solutions.",
