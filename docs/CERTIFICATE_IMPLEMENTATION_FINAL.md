   - Decorative elements

### **Certificate Templates**
- **Individual**: `data/technical_1.html` 
- **Team**: `data/technical_2.html`
- **Placeholders**: `{{participant_name}}`, `{{department_name}}`, `{{team_name}}`, `{{event_name}}`, `{{event_date}}`, `{{issue_date}}`

### **Email Configuration**
- ✅ SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com:587
- ✅ Authentication: Working

## 🎭 **PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS**

For certificate generation, students must have:
1. ✅ **Registration ID** - Student registered for event
2. ✅ **Attendance ID** - Student attended the event  
3. ✅ **Feedback ID** - Student submitted feedback

**Missing any requirement = Certificate denied** (as demonstrated with Rohan Gupta)

## 🏆 **PRODUCTION READINESS**

### **✅ Ready for Production Use**
- Real database testing completed
- Email functionality verified
- Error handling comprehensive
- Professional certificate quality maintained
- No low-quality fallbacks

### **📧 Email Notifications Working**
- Shivansh Ghelani received certificate at: shivansh_22043@ldrp.ac.in
- Riya Sharma received certificate at: autobotmyra@gmail.com

### **🎯 How to Use in Production**
```python
# Generate certificate for any eligible student
success, message, pdf_bytes = await generate_certificate_for_student(
    "DIGITAL_LITERACY_WORKSHOP_2025", 
    "22BEIT30043"
)

# Returns:
# - success: True/False
# - message: Status message
# - pdf_bytes: PDF data for download
# - Email automatically sent to student
```

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **✅ COMPLETE** - Certificate generation working with real data
2. **✅ COMPLETE** - Email delivery verified 
3. **✅ COMPLETE** - Error handling comprehensive
4. **✅ COMPLETE** - Both individual and team events supported
5. **✅ READY** - Deploy to production environment

### **For Team Events**
If you have team events with participant data, the system will automatically:
- Extract team names from participation records
- Include team names in certificates
- Generate team-specific certificates

### **Certificate Quality**
The system prioritizes quality over convenience:
- **HTML templates** are used when dependencies are available
- **Professional ReportLab PDFs** when HTML conversion fails
- **No simple/basic certificates** - maintains professional standards
