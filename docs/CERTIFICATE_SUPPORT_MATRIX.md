# Certificate Download Support Matrix

## 📊 Current System Event Types & Certificate Support

| Event Type | Registration Type | Mode | Certificate Download | Status |
|------------|------------------|------|---------------------|--------|
| **free-individual** | Free | Individual | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Active |
| **paid-individual** | Paid | Individual | ✅ **SUPPORTED** | Active |
| **free-team** | Free | Team | ❌ Not Available | Individual Only |
| **paid-team** | Paid | Team | ❌ Not Available | Individual Only |

## 🎯 Current Implementation Logic

### ✅ **Supported Events (Certificate Downloads Available)**
- **free-individual**: Students can download certificates after completing requirements
- **paid-individual**: Students can download certificates after completing requirements (NEW)

### ❌ **Not Supported Events (Certificate Downloads Not Available)**
- **free-team**: Team events not supported for certificate downloads
- **paid-team**: Team events not supported for certificate downloads

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Logic (`utils/certificate_generator.py`)
```python
def _is_eligible_event(self, event: Dict) -> bool:
    """Check if event is eligible for certificate generation"""
    registration_type = event.get('registration_type', '').lower()
    registration_mode = event.get('registration_mode', '').lower()
    
    # Support both free and paid individual events
    return registration_mode == 'individual' and registration_type in ['free', 'paid']
```

### Frontend Logic (`templates/client/certificate_download.html`)
```django
{% if event.registration_mode == 'individual' and event.registration_type in ['free', 'paid'] %}
    <!-- Show download button -->
{% else %}
    <!-- Show "under development" message -->
{% endif %}
```

## 📋 Certificate Download Requirements

For **individual events** (free or paid), students must complete:

1. ✅ **Registration**: Student must be registered for the event
2. ✅ **Attendance**: Student must have attended the event (attendance marked)
3. ✅ **Feedback**: Student must have submitted feedback
4. ✅ **Event Type**: Event must be individual mode (free or paid)

## 🚀 System Workflow

### For Individual Events (Supported):
```
Registration → Payment (if paid) → Attendance → Feedback → Certificate Download
```

### For Team Events (Not Supported):
```
Registration → Payment (if paid) → Attendance → Feedback → No Certificate Available
```
