# Feedback Form Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Next Button Not Working on First Step**
   - Fixed a syntax error in `feedback_form.html` where there was an extra closing curly brace `}` after the `getPrevStepNumber` function that was prematurely terminating the script block.
   - Updated event handling in `test_feedback_steps.html` to properly handle button clicks.

2. **Step Navigation Logic**
   - Verified that `getVisibleSteps()` correctly identifies which steps should be shown based on event type
   - Confirmed `createStepMapping()` properly maps actual step numbers to sequential display numbers
   - Tested that `getCurrentDisplayStep()` returns the correct display step for the UI

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created dedicated testing tools:
     - `verify_step_navigation.js`: Script to test step navigation logic
     - `step_navigation_verification.html`: Interactive test page for all event types

## How the Step Navigation Works

1. **Step Visibility**:
   - Steps 1-4 and 7 are always visible
   - Step 5 is only visible for team-based events
   - Step 6 is only visible for paid events

2. **Step Mapping**:
   - Actual step numbers in the HTML are preserved (1-7)
   - Display step numbers are consecutive (1 to total visible steps)
   - Example mapping for individual free event:
     - Actual steps: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
     - Display steps: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

3. **Navigation Flow**:
   - `getNextStepNumber()`: Gets the next visible step's actual number
   - `getPrevStepNumber()`: Gets the previous visible step's actual number
   - `showStep()`: Updates UI to display the selected step

## Testing Scenarios

| Event Type | Visible Steps | Step Mapping |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Individual Free | 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 | 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, 7→5 |
| Individual Paid | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 | 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, 6→5, 7→6 |
| Team Free | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 | 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, 5→5, 7→6 |
| Team Paid | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | 1→1, 2→2, 3→3, 4→4, 5→5, 6→6, 7→7 |

## Additional Verification

- Created and tested with `step_navigation_verification.html` to interactively verify that:
  1. Next/previous navigation works for all event types
  2. Step counter shows the correct display step numbers
  3. Progress bar calculates correct percentages based on visible steps

## Debugging Steps

If navigation issues occur in the future:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that `currentActualStep` is being updated correctly
3. Ensure there are no syntax errors in the JavaScript functions
4. Check that the event listeners for navigation buttons are properly attached
